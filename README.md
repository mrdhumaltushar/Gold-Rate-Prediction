# 🪙 Gold Price Forecasting using Prophet

Forecasting gold prices with **Meta’s Prophet** — a powerful time-series model — and visualizing future trends through **interactive Plotly charts**.  
This project also includes exporting forecast results to **Excel (.xlsx)** and **HTML dashboards**, making it ideal for financial analysis and reporting.

## 📖 Overview

Predicting gold prices is essential for **investors**, **economists**, and **financial analysts**.  
This project demonstrates how to use **Prophet**, a forecasting model developed by Meta (formerly Facebook), to analyze historical gold price trends and predict future prices.

The model is trained on real historical gold data and produces both:
- **Interactive forecasts** (displayed in Jupyter Notebook)
- **Exportable forecast reports** (Excel + HTML)


## 🌟 Features

✅ Load, clean, and prepare historical gold price data  
✅ Train Prophet model for up to **10-year forecast**  
✅ Display **interactive Plotly charts** directly in Jupyter Notebook  
✅ Export forecast results to **Excel (.xlsx)** and **HTML dashboard**  
✅ Clean, modular, and reusable Python code
